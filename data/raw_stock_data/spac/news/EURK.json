      "summary": "Eureka Acquisition Corp (NASDAQ: EURK), a blank check company, has entered into a business combination agreement with Marine Thinking Inc., an autonomous ship and fleet solutions company. The deal involves EURK domesticating to Canada as \"Marine Thinking Holdings Inc.\" and then amalgamating with a Canadian subsidiary of EURK to become a wholly-owned subsidiary. Despite reporting net income for the year ended September 30, 2025, due to interest on trust investments, EURK faces a working capital deficiency and significant shareholder redemptions, raising substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern if the business combination is not completed by its SPAC deadline.",
