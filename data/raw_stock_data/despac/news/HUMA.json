This partnership will utilize Pluristyx's panCELLa\u2122 platform to create \"hypoimmune\" cells for treating insulin-dependent diabetes, with Pluristyx also performing custom gene editing to generate a universally applicable iPSC line for Humacyte's BVP development program. The BVP aims to revolutionize type 1 diabetes treatment by enabling the survival and delivery of insulin-producing islets inside the body.",
