The video platform plans to use $250 million of the investment to support its growth, with the remainder funding a self-tender offer for Class A shares. This significant investment aims to boost Rumble's market presence, which has struggled since its 2022 debut, aligning with shared values of decentralization and free expression.",

Despite repeated attempts by Rumble to highlight these errors, which indicate Rumble meets the minimum voting rights threshold, LSEG staff have refused to correct their mistake. Rumble argues that this refusal not only harms their company but also undermines the accuracy and integrity of the Russell 3000 Index for all investors.",
