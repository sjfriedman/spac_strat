This decline occurred despite a substantial increase in capital employed, suggesting inefficient reinvestment and a weak business model. The company's stock has consequently seen a 100% decrease in the last three years, prompting caution for investors.",

The company's low price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1.2x, significantly lower than the IT industry average, is attributed to deteriorating revenue which declined 28% last year and 34% over three years, contrasting sharply with the industry's projected 19% growth.
