Despite this, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1.2x remains low compared to the Aerospace & Defense industry, indicating potential undervaluation given recent revenue declines. Analysts forecast a 10% revenue growth for AerSale next year, similar to the broader industry, yet its P/S continues to lag, suggesting investor skepticism about future growth.",
