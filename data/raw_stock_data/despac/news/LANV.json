The company's revenue has declined by 24% over the last year, and analysts forecast a modest 3.1% growth, significantly lower than the industry's 5.5% projection. This disparity suggests that the current P/S ratio might not fully reflect the revenue challenges, potentially leading to future disappointment for investors.",
