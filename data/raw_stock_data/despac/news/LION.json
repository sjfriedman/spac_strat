(NYSE: LION) concluded the week near its 52-week high, driven by optimism around its FAST and ad-tech monetization strategy, despite analyst targets being relatively close to its current price. However, a new legal headline regarding a lawsuit against Tyler Perry, which also names Lionsgate as a distributor, presents a potential short-term sentiment overhang for the stock as markets prepare to reopen. The article highlights that the stock's performance on Monday will be a test of whether momentum can hold against this new headline risk in a low-liquidity trading environment.",
