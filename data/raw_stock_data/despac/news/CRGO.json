      "summary": "Freightos, a Jerusalem-based online freight booking and payment platform, is laying off 50 employees, or 13% of its workforce, due to a slump in global shipping markets and persistent global headwinds. This workforce reduction is part of a cost-saving and operational efficiency plan aimed at achieving profitability with existing cash reserves without needing to raise more capital. The company, which went public on Nasdaq earlier this year, has seen its stock plunge by about 63% since its IPO amidst a global economic slowdown affecting freight markets.",
