      "summary": "Nokia's selection of Amprius Technologies (AMPX) SiCore cells for its next-generation drone networks has highlighted the battery maker's technology, coinciding with significant momentum in Amprius's share price, which has seen nearly a 500% return in a year. While one narrative suggests the company is 29% undervalued with a fair value of $17.17 based on aggressive growth and margin expansion assumptions, another valuation lens focusing on the price-to-sales ratio indicates the market is already paying heavily for future growth, with a P/S of 27.2x compared to an industry average of 2.2x. This suggests less margin for error if execution falters, despite the optimistic analyst targets.",
