The settlement, awaiting preliminary approval, would provide 150 \"DraftKing Dollars\" to each of the nearly 200 Class Members who paid $10,000 to enter, with additional payouts for the named plaintiff and class counsel. DraftKings denies liability but agreed to the settlement to avoid further litigation costs, and will also post clearer rules for future championships.",
