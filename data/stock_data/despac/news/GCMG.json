The global alternative asset management firm, despite experiencing a 3-year revenue growth decline, showcases strong operating and net margins, and good liquidity, though its debt-to-equity ratio is negative and insider selling has been observed. Valuation metrics suggest potential undervaluation, with a 'Buy' consensus from analysts and technical indicators pointing to oversold territory.",
