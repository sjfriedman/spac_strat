      "summary": "Vertiv (VRT) shares fell by over 2% on December 16, 2025, reaching around $158, following a volatile period stemming from a Wolfe Research downgrade, its exclusion from the S&P 500, and profit-taking after significant gains. Despite the stock's recent pressure, the company's fundamentals remain strong, driven by robust AI data-center infrastructure demand, evidenced by accelerating orders and a growing backlog, as well as the strategic acquisition of PurgeRite. Analysts generally maintain a \"Moderate Buy\" to \"Buy\" consensus with varying price targets, indicating a mixed sentiment between strong business fundamentals and valuation concerns.",
