Despite a turbulent year for shareholders with a 70% share price tumble, the stock currently trades at a significantly discounted price-to-sales ratio of 2.1x, suggesting potential undervaluation compared to industry and peer benchmarks. Investors are urged to consider the potential for a turnaround given the renewed growth focus, yet acknowledge sustained losses and negative shareholder returns.",
