      "summary": "D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) has seen a dramatic share price increase of over 500% in the past year, leading to a reevaluation of its valuation. Despite this surge and analysts still seeing upside, its price-to-book ratio of 14.8x is significantly higher than the US Software industry average of 3.4x, suggesting the market is baking in substantial future growth expectations. This premium valuation implies that investors are anticipating strong commercial adoption of quantum computing to justify the current stock price, even with ongoing risks like steep losses and potential delays in market adoption.",
