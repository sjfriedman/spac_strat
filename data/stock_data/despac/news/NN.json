      "summary": "ARRL has filed comments with the FCC to protect the 902-928 MHz amateur radio band against a proposal from NextNav Inc. The proposal would reconfigure the band for high-powered 5G cellular services, which ARRL argues would cause massive interference and displace amateur radio operators who use the band for public service, experimentation, and emergency communications, including mesh networks. ARRL highlights the band's critical role for amateur radio, stressing that there are no suitable alternative bands for these vital operations.",
