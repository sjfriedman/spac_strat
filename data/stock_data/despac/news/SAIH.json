Despite a net loss in FY2024 due to R&D, the company exceeded revenue estimates, with analysts highlighting its significant valuation discount compared to peers and its strategic position in high-growth markets. SAIHEAT's integrated approach of nuclear technology with data center thermal management positions it uniquely to capitalize on the growing demand for energy-efficient computing.",
