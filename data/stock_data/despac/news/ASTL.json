Marie, Ont., according to the United Steelworkers local 2724 president, Bill Slater. He indicates that up to 500 workers could return by the end of next year through expanded capacity, possibly with a government loan. These developments follow recent layoff notices and Algoma Steel's request for $500 million in federal support due to U.S. tariffs.",

The loans were intended to help the company adapt to new technology, become more competitive, and maintain jobs, but the transition to less labor-intensive electric-arc furnaces and the impact of steel tariffs have led to significant job losses. Industry experts suggest the funding is crucial for maintaining Canada's steel industry, particularly for environmental upgrades and technology adoption, even if it results in reduced employment due to efficiency gains.",
