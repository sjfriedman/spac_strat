(NASDAQ: XBP) stock surged by 88.87% following its acquisition of Exela Technologies BPA, LLC, a move that transforms XBP into a global leader in business process automation with over $900 million in annual revenue. This strategic acquisition improved XBP's financial structure by cutting $1.1 billion of debt and is fueling investor excitement due to its expansion into AI-powered solutions and increased market scale. However, the stock faces risks including past unprofitability, integration challenges, and high volatility, making it a high-reward, high-risk investment.",
