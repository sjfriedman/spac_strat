The company's low price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1.4x, compared to an industry average of 2.7x, is linked to disappointing revenue performance with a 12% decrease over the last year and a 15% fall over three years. Given the declining revenue and the industry's expected growth of 6.2%, investors are unlikely to justify a higher P/S ratio in the near future.",
