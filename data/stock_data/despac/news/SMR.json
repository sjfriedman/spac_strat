This price hike, even with substantial subsidies, raises concerns among participating utilities who might terminate their power purchase agreements without penalty. The project also faces challenges with low subscription rates and a high likelihood of further cost increases and schedule delays, echoing trends seen in other nuclear construction projects.",
