      "summary": "Oklo Inc. (NYSE: OKLO) stock experienced a significant slide on December 17, 2025, despite announcing progress on plutonium-fueled reactor development. The decline is attributed to renewed pressure on the \"AI energy trade\" due to concerns about the timeline for AI data-center buildouts, which could delay power procurement decisions, and ongoing investor dilution concerns from a large at-the-market offering. This volatility highlights how pre-revenue, narrative-driven stocks like Oklo are highly sensitive to market sentiment and macro shifts.",

While Oklo remains pre-revenue with a large cash reserve, NuScale missed Q3 earnings significantly due to a milestone contribution, despite securing a large deal with TVA. The article suggests Oklo, despite its lack of revenue, appears to be a safer bet due to its strong cash position and absence of credibility issues that NuScale faces.",

This strong endorsement from an AI industry leader aims to alleviate skepticism surrounding SMR developers like NuScale Power Corp., Nano Nuclear Energy, Inc., and Oklo, Inc., whose stocks faced a downturn in November. Huang's projection of hundreds of megawatt-range SMRs powering data centers within six to seven years provides a credible timeline and shifts focus from the companies' risk to the significant market opportunity presented by AI's energy demands.",
