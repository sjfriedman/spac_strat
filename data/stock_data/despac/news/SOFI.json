      "summary": "SoFi Technologies Inc. shares are trading marginally higher on Wednesday, rebounding from dilution concerns after a $1.5 billion equity offering. Investor sentiment is bolstered by new product launches and a strategic partnership, but the primary driver for the stock remains the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision. Lower interest rates could significantly boost SoFi's student loan and mortgage refinancing volumes, improve net interest margins, and increase the present value of its future cash flows.",
