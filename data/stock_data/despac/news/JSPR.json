Concurrently, an internal investigation into anomalous BEACON study data concluded that the lack of efficacy in some U.S. patients was due to patient selection issues rather than drug product quality, as most of those patients did not have mast cell-driven chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). The company plans further development of briquilimab for asthma and anticipates additional BEACON data in Q1 2026.",
