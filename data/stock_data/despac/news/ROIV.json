Despite trading at a premium to the US biotech industry on a price-to-book basis, the company is considered 12.2% undervalued by Simply Wall St's narrative, with a fair value of $25.64 against its current price of $22.50. This valuation hinges on future earnings from a potential $10 billion+ peak sales portfolio and ongoing business development activities, though risks like trial setbacks or unfavorable litigation outcomes exist.",
