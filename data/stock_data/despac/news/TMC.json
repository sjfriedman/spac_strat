(NASDAQ: TMC), saw its stock slide over 10% on Friday into the year-end weekend, amidst thin holiday trading and a renewed focus on the U.S. regulatory timeline for deep seabed mining. The NOAA's announcement of a public comment period and virtual hearings in January 2026 for deep seabed mining exploration licenses is creating a time-specific catalyst that investors are closely watching, highlighting the stock's event-driven nature. Despite analyst targets suggesting potential upside, the significant dispersion in these targets and meaningful short interest underscore the high uncertainty surrounding the pre-revenue company's path to commercialization, which hinges on regulatory approvals and financing.",
