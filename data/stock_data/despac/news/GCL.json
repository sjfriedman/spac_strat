Despite this, the company's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.8x is notably lower than the industry average, which could indicate a potential undervaluation or market skepticism about its sustainability. While GCL Global Holdings has experienced rapid revenue growth of 46% last year and 116% over the last three years, outperforming the industry's 19% growth forecast, investors appear unconvinced that these growth rates can be maintained.",

      "summary": "GCL Global Holdings Ltd's stock has dropped 26% in the last 30 days, contributing to a 77% share price decline over the year. Despite the fall, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2x aligns with the Entertainment industry median in the US. While GCL Global Holdings has shown strong revenue growth of 46% over the last year and 116% over three years, exceeding industry expectations, its P/S ratio indicates that investors may not be convinced of sustained growth.",
