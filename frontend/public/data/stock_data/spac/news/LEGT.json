McQuade recently reported selling US$2.05 million, diminishing his holding by 67%, while Sgro sold US$682,294 and proposed to sell an additional US$2.04 million. These sales have prompted cautious observation from market analysts, especially with a new 'Say on Pay' policy on executive compensation set for a shareholder vote.",
