While state officials highlight rate stability and new companies entering the market, others argue that actual savings for policyholders are yet to be seen, with South Florida experiencing the highest increases.",

This surge, attributed to a hardening market and past fraudulent claims, is leading to a 42% increase in resident assessments and is a concern for other island complexes. Condo insurance agents are suggesting lobbying state legislators to relax Citizens Property Insurance Corp. guidelines to address the issue.",
