This move positions Kyivstar as the first pure-play Ukrainian investment opportunity in U.S. stock markets, with VEON retaining an 89.6% stake. The low redemption rate from Cohen Circle shareholders indicates strong investor confidence in Kyivstar's growth prospects and contributions to Ukraine's economic resilience.",
