Despite a low price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.2x compared to the industry average of 1.9x, the company's declining revenue over the past year and three years suggests the low P/S might be justified. Further investigation indicates that the shrinking revenue is a key factor in its low P/S ratio, and without improved top-line growth, the share price is unlikely to see significant movement.",
