This is attributed to a focus on sales in Asia, where prices are lower. The company also faces an SEC subpoena related to allegations from a short seller about a large order announcement and has seen its stock price fall significantly from its 52-week high, although it projects 500-700 deliveries in fiscal year 2022.",
