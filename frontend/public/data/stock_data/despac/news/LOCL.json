      "summary": "Local Bounti, a Montana-based controlled environment agriculture company, went public in November through a reverse merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Co-CEO Craig Hurlbert emphasized the company's focus on unit economics and its \"stack and flow\" growing system, which is a hybrid of greenhouse and vertical farming. They have attracted investors like Cargill and partnered with grocery chain Albertsons, aiming to disrupt the produce business by offering sustainably grown, cleaner products.",
