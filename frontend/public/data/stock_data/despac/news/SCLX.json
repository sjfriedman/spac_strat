While analysts are divided, with some seeing significant upside due to strategic deals and capital infusion, others warn of high volatility, substantial dilution risk from the Bitcoin deal, and the stock being significantly overvalued relative to its minimal revenue and institutional holdings. The sustainability of this rally hinges on forthcoming Q3 earnings, shareholder approval of the Bitcoin tranche, and the successful launch and monetization of new data exchanges.",
