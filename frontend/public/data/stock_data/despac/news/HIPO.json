It highlights several companies like Hippo Holdings, Enjoy Technology, Electric Last Mile, and Voyager Digital, some of which resorted to reverse splits while others, unable to recover, filed for bankruptcy. The author, Wolf Richter, argues that reverse stock splits only address delisting threats temporarily and do not solve underlying financial viability problems, ultimately predicting that many of these companies will still fail unless they achieve positive cash flow.",
