      "summary": "The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation has awarded up to $5 million to BiomX Inc. for a phase 1b/2a clinical trial to assess the safety and tolerability of bacteriophage therapy in treating Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in CF patients. This trial aims to evaluate BX004, a cocktail of phages, for safety, clinical activity, and drug metabolism in two phases, initially with eight patients and then expanding to twenty-four. This initiative is critical for developing new approaches to treat drug-resistant bacteria in people with cystic fibrosis.",
