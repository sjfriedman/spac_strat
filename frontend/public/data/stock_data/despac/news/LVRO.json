      "summary": "Lavoro Limited received a notice of non-compliance from Nasdaq due to the delayed filing of its Form 20-F for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025. This notice does not immediately affect the listing of its securities but requires Lavoro to submit a compliance plan by November 28, 2025. The delay stems from complexities related to its EJ Plan introduced in June 2025, and Nasdaq has granted a previous extension for another filing, with any further compliance extension limited to 180 days.",
