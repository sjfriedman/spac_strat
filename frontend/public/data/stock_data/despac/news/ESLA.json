      "summary": "Estrella Immunopharma announced that the first patient in its STARLIGHT-1 Phase I/II clinical trial for EB103 CD19-Redirected ARTEMIS\u00ae T Cells achieved a complete response one month after treatment. The patient, who had follicular lymphoma grade 3A with high-risk 3B symptoms and had relapsed three times, showed no detectable signs of disease and no treatment-related serious adverse events. This early success highlights the potential of ARTEMIS\u00ae T-cell therapies to offer improved safety and efficacy compared to commercially available CAR-T treatments, aiming to broaden patient accessibility.",
