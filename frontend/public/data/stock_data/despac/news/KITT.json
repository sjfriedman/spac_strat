      "summary": "Engineers who previously developed robot astronauts at NASA's Johnson Space Center are now applying their expertise to create the Aquanaut, a shape-changing submersible robot for maritime industries. This robot aims to significantly reduce operational costs for offshore activities like oil wells, wind turbines, and fish farms by enabling tasks with minimal human supervision and eliminating the need for expensive support vessels. The Aquanaut's design leverages lessons from space robotics, emphasizing autonomy and remote operation in harsh, distant environments, making it versatile for various subsea jobs.",
