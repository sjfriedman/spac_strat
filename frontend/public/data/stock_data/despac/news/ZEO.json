      "summary": "Zeo Energy Corp. (NASDAQ:ZEO) has a low price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.7x, which is significantly below the industry average. This low P/S is primarily attributed to the company's receding revenue, including an 11% decrease in the last year and a 22% overall fall in revenue over the last three years. Given that the broader Electrical industry is expected to grow by 12% next year, Zeo Energy's shrinking revenues make its low P/S understandable, though it suggests potential for further disappointment if growth doesn't improve.",
